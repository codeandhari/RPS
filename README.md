# RPS
This is a simple code that is used to play Rock , paper , scissor with CPU . I've built this using c++ to just improve my logical thinking.
To use this kindly copy the code from the RPS.cpp and paste it in https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler or if you have your own c++ compiler you can run it 
in your own system.
